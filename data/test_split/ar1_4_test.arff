% --Description:
% Embedded software in a white-goods product.
% Implemented in C.
% Consists of 121 modules (9 defective / 112 defect-free)
% 29 static code attributes (McCabe, Halstead and LOC measures) and 1 defect information(false/true)
% Function/method level static code attributes are collected using
% Prest Metrics Extraction and Analysis Tool [1].
