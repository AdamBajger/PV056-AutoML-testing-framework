% 7. Attribute Information:
%
%   1:  surgery?
%           1 = Yes, it had surgery
%           2 = It was treated without surgery
%
%   2:  Age
%           1 = Adult horse
%           2 = Young (< 6 months)
%
%   3:  Hospital Number
%           - numeric id
%           - the case number assigned to the horse
%             (may not be unique if the horse is treated > 1 time)
%
%   4:  rectal temperature
%           - linear
%           - in degrees celsius.
%           - An elevated temp may occur due to infection.
%           - temperature may be reduced when the animal is in late shock
%           - normal temp is 37.8
%           - this parameter will usually change as the problem progresses
%                eg. may start out normal, then become elevated because of
%                    the lesion, passing back through the normal range as the
%                    horse goes into shock
%   5:  pulse
%           - linear
%           - the heart rate in beats per minute
%           - is a reflection of the heart condition: 30 -40 is normal for adults
%           - rare to have a lower than normal rate although athletic horses
%             may have a rate of 20-25
%           - animals with painful lesions or suffering from circulatory shock
%             may have an elevated heart rate
%
%   6:  respiratory rate
%           - linear
%           - normal rate is 8 to 10
%           - usefulness is doubtful due to the great fluctuations
%
%   7:  temperature of extremities
%           - a subjective indication of peripheral circulation
%           - possible values:
%                1 = Normal
%                2 = Warm
%                3 = Cool
%                4 = Cold
%           - cool to cold extremities indicate possible shock
%           - hot extremities should correlate with an elevated rectal temp.
%
%   8:  peripheral pulse
%           - subjective
%           - possible values are:
%                1 = normal
%                2 = increased
%                3 = reduced
%                4 = absent
%           - normal or increased p.p. are indicative of adequate circulation
%             while reduced or absent indicate poor perfusion
%
%   9:  mucous membranes
%           - a subjective measurement of colour
%           - possible values are:
%                1 = normal pink
%                2 = bright pink
%                3 = pale pink
%                4 = pale cyanotic
%                5 = bright red / injected
%                6 = dark cyanotic
%           - 1 and 2 probably indicate a normal or slightly increased
%             circulation
%           - 3 may occur in early shock
%           - 4 and 6 are indicative of serious circulatory compromise
%           - 5 is more indicative of a septicemia
%
%  10: capillary refill time
%           - a clinical judgement. The longer the refill, the poorer the
%             circulation
%           - possible values
%                1 = < 3 seconds
%                2 = >= 3 seconds
%
%  11: pain - a subjective judgement of the horse's pain level
%           - possible values:
%                1 = alert, no pain
%                2 = depressed
%                3 = intermittent mild pain
%                4 = intermittent severe pain
%                5 = continuous severe pain
%           - should NOT be treated as a ordered or discrete variable!
%           - In general, the more painful, the more likely it is to require
%             surgery
%           - prior treatment of pain may mask the pain level to some extent
%
%  12: peristalsis
%           - an indication of the activity in the horse's gut. As the gut
%             becomes more distended or the horse becomes more toxic, the
%             activity decreases
%           - possible values:
%                1 = hypermotile
%                2 = normal
%                3 = hypomotile
%                4 = absent
%
%  13: abdominal distension
%           - An IMPORTANT parameter.
%           - possible values
%                1 = none
%                2 = slight
%                3 = moderate
%                4 = severe
%           - an animal with abdominal distension is likely to be painful and
%             have reduced gut motility.
%           - a horse with severe abdominal distension is likely to require
%             surgery just tio relieve the pressure
%
%  14: nasogastric tube
%           - this refers to any gas coming out of the tube
%           - possible values:
%                1 = none
%                2 = slight
%                3 = significant
%           - a large gas cap in the stomach is likely to give the horse
%             discomfort
%
%  15: nasogastric reflux
%           - possible values
%                1 = none
%                2 = > 1 liter
%                3 = < 1 liter
%           - the greater amount of reflux, the more likelihood that there is
%             some serious obstruction to the fluid passage from the rest of
%             the intestine
%
%  16: nasogastric reflux PH
%           - linear
%           - scale is from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral
%           - normal values are in the 3 to 4 range
%
%  17: rectal examination - feces
%           - possible values
%                1 = normal
%                2 = increased
%                3 = decreased
%                4 = absent
%           - absent feces probably indicates an obstruction
%
%  18: abdomen
%           - possible values
%                1 = normal
%                2 = other
%                3 = firm feces in the large intestine
%                4 = distended small intestine
%                5 = distended large intestine
%           - 3 is probably an obstruction caused by a mechanical impaction
%             and is normally treated medically
%           - 4 and 5 indicate a surgical lesion
%
%  19: packed cell volume
%           - linear
%           - the # of red cells by volume in the blood
%           - normal range is 30 to 50. The level rises as the circulation
%             becomes compromised or as the animal becomes dehydrated.
%
%  20: total protein
%           - linear
%           - normal values lie in the 6-7.5 (gms/dL) range
%           - the higher the value the greater the dehydration
%
%  21: abdominocentesis appearance
%           - a needle is put in the horse's abdomen and fluid is obtained from
%             the abdominal cavity
%           - possible values:
%                1 = clear
%                2 = cloudy
%                3 = serosanguinous
%           - normal fluid is clear while cloudy or serosanguinous indicates
%             a compromised gut
%
%  22: abdomcentesis total protein
%           - linear
%           - the higher the level of protein the more likely it is to have a
%             compromised gut. Values are in gms/dL
%
%  23: outcome
%           - what eventually happened to the horse?
%           - possible values:
%                1 = lived
%                2 = died
%                3 = was euthanized
%
%  24: surgical lesion?
%           - retrospectively, was the problem (lesion) surgical?
%           - all cases are either operated upon or autopsied so that
%             this value and the lesion type are always known
%           - possible values:
%                1 = Yes
%                2 = No
