% 4.  Relevant Information:
%
%     This file concerns credit card applications.  All attribute names
%     and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect
%     confidentiality of the data.
%
%     This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of
%     attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of
%     values, and nominal with larger numbers of values.  There
%     are also a few missing values.
