% ABSTRACT: Machine learning tools show significant promise for
% knowledge acquisition, particularly when human expertise is
% inadequate. Recently, process delays known as cylinder banding in
% rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules
% discovered by decision tree induction. Our work exemplifies a more
% general methodology which transforms the knowledge acquisition task
% from one in which rules are directly elicited from an expert, to one
% in which a learning system is responsible for rule generation. The
% primary responsibilities of the human expert are to evaluate the
% merits of generated rules, and to guide the acquisition and
% classification of data necessary for machine induction. These
% responsibilities require the expert to do what an expert does best: to
% exercise his or her expertise. This seems a more natural fit to an
% expert's capabilities than the requirements of traditional
% methodologies that experts explicitly enumerate the rules that they
% employ.
