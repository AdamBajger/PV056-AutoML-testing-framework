%    This file describes the contents of the heart-disease directory.
%
%    This directory contains 4 databases concerning heart disease diagnosis.
%    All attributes are numeric-valued.  The data was collected from the
%    four following locations:
%
%      1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
%      2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data)
%      3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data)
%      4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)
%
%    Each database has the same instance format.  While the databases have 76
%    raw attributes, only 14 of them are actually used.  Thus I've taken the
%    liberty of making 2 copies of each database: one with all the attributes
%    and 1 with the 14 attributes actually used in past experiments.
%
%    The authors of the databases have requested:
%
%       ...that any publications resulting from the use of the data include the
%       names of the principal investigator responsible for the data collection
%       at each institution.  They would be:
%
%        1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
%        2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
%        3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
%        4. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation:
%           Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.
%
%    Thanks in advance for abiding by this request.

%
% 4. Relevant Information:
%      This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments
%      refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland
%      database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
%      this date.  The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease
%      in the patient.  It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
%      Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply
%      attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value
%      0).
%
%      The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently
%      removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
%
%      One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland
%      database.  All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.
